This is a game console powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico,with features like a dynamic home screen and a settings menu, where you can change the background,volume and more.And it's all in Micropython.


## Credits
The idea came from the [PicoGameBoy](https://github.com/YouMakeTech/Pi-Pico-Game-Boy) and the [PicoBoy](https://github.com/HalloSpaceBoy5/PicoBoy) projects also on 
GitHub.
